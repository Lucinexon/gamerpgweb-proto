   THE POLYMATH CODEX — js/systems.js  ·  LIVING MAINFRAME UPGRADE
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SystemsEngine — five subsystems, zero new dependencies (no CDNs, no
   modules, no imports). Loaded BEFORE engine.js as a classic script:

     · TelemetryRadar   — 2D canvas radar sweep + oscilloscope (HiDPI,
                          cancelAnimationFrame lifecycle, reduced-motion safe)
     · ProbeManager     — persistent background expeditions via Date.now()
                          vs launchedAt (3 tiers: 2h / 8h / 24h), Telemetry
                          Surge hooks, loot + Data Cache drops, energy economy
     · DecayEngine      — Signal Retention / Node Integrity: Ebbinghaus
                          R(t) = exp(-dt / (S * 86400000)) * 100, status
                          badges (OPTIMAL / ATTENUATED / DEGRADED), 3-question
                          Targeted Audits that restore 100% and increment S
     · DispatchManager  — 0600 Dispatch: deterministic offline daily
                          transmissions (paradox + calibration query), +1
                          Chrono Metric, +25 energy, daily streak
     · BYOKClient       — operator link: custom Base URL + arbitrary model
                          string + masked key (localStorage only) + 1-token
                          connection test with detailed error reporting

   ENGINE COUPLING CONTRACT: this file executes before engine.js, so every
   engine global ($, $$, esc, shuffle, mdInline, typeset, drawSprites, toast,
   sfx, gainXP, celebrate, openModal, S, save, SECTORS, NAVMAP, QUIZZES,
   REDUCED, levelOf) is referenced LAZILY inside function bodies only —
   never at evaluation time. engine.js calls SystemsEngine.init() from its
   own DOMContentLoaded boot cycle.

    { t: 'Olbers’ Paradox', b: 'In an infinite, static, eternal universe every line of sight ends on a star, and the night sky should blaze like the surface of the sun. Darkness is direct evidence of a finite-age, expanding universe.' },
    { t: 'The Fermi Paradox', b: 'Billions of galaxies, billions of years, no visitors. Where is everybody? Every term of the Drake equation is a fight between telescopes and silence.' },

    { t: 'The Quantum Zeno Effect', b: 'An unstable particle observed continuously never decays — a watched pot that mathematically refuses to boil. Sufficiently frequent measurement freezes the evolution of the wavefunction.' },
    { t: 'Schrödinger’s Cat', b: 'Seal a cat’s fate to a quantum event and the formalism says it is alive-and-dead until observed. The paradox is a reductio: where, exactly, does the quantum world end?' },
    { t: 'The Twin Paradox', b: 'Both twins see the other’s clock run slow, yet only one comes home younger. The symmetry breaks at the turnaround: acceleration is absolute, arguments are not.' },
    { t: 'The Grandfather Paradox', b: 'Travel back and prevent your own birth — then who traveled? Physics offers chronology protection and branching timelines; logic offers a headache.' },
    { t: 'The Bootstrap Paradox', b: 'A time traveler hands Shakespeare his own collected works, which Shakespeare then "writes". The information exists with no author and no origin — a causal loop missing its first cause.' },

    { t: 'The Ehrenfest Paradox', b: 'A rigid rotating disc cannot stay rigid: the rim contracts relative to the center, so its geometry refuses Euclid. Rotation strains the absolutes of space itself.' },
    { t: 'The Black Hole Information Paradox', b: 'Hawking radiation is thermal and seems to carry no information out of a black hole, yet quantum mechanics forbids information loss. Decades of proposals; still open.' },
    { t: 'The Hubble Tension', b: 'Early-universe and local measurements of the expansion rate disagree beyond 5 sigma: roughly 67 versus 73 km/s/Mpc. Something in cosmology is wrong and no one knows which thing.' },
    { t: 'Poincaré Recurrence', b: 'In a finite box with finite energy, the system will eventually revisit any given state to arbitrary precision. Given enough time, this exact reading happens again.' },
    { t: 'Loschmidt’s Paradox', b: 'The microscopic laws are time-symmetric, yet the macroscopic world has a stubborn arrow. The asymmetry hides in the initial conditions, not the equations.' },
    { t: 'The Gibbs Paradox', b: 'Mix two identical gases and entropy does not increase; mix two different gases and it does. Identical particles are fundamentally indistinguishable, and thermodynamics keeps score.' },
    { t: 'Wigner’s Friend', b: 'Wigner’s friend measures a particle and records a definite result; Wigner, outside the sealed lab, assigns it a superposition. Whose facts are the facts?' },
    { t: 'The Quantum Pigeonhole Principle', b: 'Put three pigeons in two holes and classically some pair must share. In quantum mechanics, no two pigeons are in the same hole while every pair is measured — pairs are not built from individuals.' },
    { t: 'Hilbert’s Hotel', b: 'A hotel with infinitely many rooms is completely full — and can still accommodate infinitely many new guests, just by shifting every room. Infinity has room-service problems.' },
    { t: 'Cantor’s Diagonal Argument', b: 'The reals outrank the naturals: any list of reals misses one you can build from its own diagonal. Some infinities are strictly bigger than others.' },
    { t: 'Russell’s Paradox', b: 'Consider the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. Does it contain itself? Both answers explode. Naive set theory needed axioms after this.' },
    { t: 'The Raven Paradox', b: '"All ravens are black" is confirmed by every non-black non-raven — every green apple in the world. Confirmation has logical edges that intuition refuses to walk.' },
    { t: 'Goodman’s Grue', b: 'Define "grue" as green before a certain date and blue after. All emeralds observed so far are equally green and grue. Induction cannot choose between the regularities.' },
    { t: 'Gödel’s Incompleteness', b: 'Any consistent formal system rich enough for arithmetic contains true statements it cannot prove — including, if it is consistent, its own consistency.' },
    { t: 'The Drinker Paradox', b: 'In any non-empty bar there is someone such that, if they are drinking, everyone is drinking. Provably true in classical logic; try asking the bartender to point them out.' },
    { t: 'The Lottery Paradox', b: 'It is rational to believe each individual ticket will lose, and irrational to believe all tickets lose. Rational belief is not closed under conjunction.' },
    { t: 'Parrondo’s Paradox', b: 'Two games, each losing on its own, can be combined — even alternating randomly — into a winning game. The ratchet hides in the coupling between them.' },
    { t: 'The Two-Envelope Paradox', b: 'One envelope holds twice the other. Whichever you hold, switching seems to improve expectation by 25% — for both envelopes. The flaw rides on an improper prior.' },
    { t: 'Benford’s Law', b: 'In real-world datasets the digit 1 leads about 30% of the time and 9 about 5%. Cooked ledgers bend the curve — and forensic accountants read the bend.' }
